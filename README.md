# Advent of Code 3023 - Lua

The repo contains my solutions for AoC 2023.
I'm learning Lua from scratch with this event,
so the code might be (and probably is) suboptimal.

## Running the code

_Note: The code is written in Lua 5.1 (to run on LuaJIT),
so it may not work on newer versions of Lua._

To run the solutions, create `input.txt` file in a directory for a specific day,
and run:

```sh
# for LuaJIT:
luajit dayXX/main.lua

# for Lua 5.1:
lua dayXX/main.lua
```

where `XX` is a day number (for example `01`).

_Note: `day00` directory contains a template for creating specific day directories_
