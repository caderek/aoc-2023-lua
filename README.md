# Advent of Code 3023 - Lua

The repo contains my solutions for AoC 2023.
I learn Lua from scratch with this event,
so the code might (and probably is) suboptimal.

## Running the code

_Note: The code is written in Lua 5.1 (to run on LuaJIT),
so it may not work on newer versions of Lua._

To run the solutions, create `input.txt` file in a directory for a specific day,
and run:

```sh
luajit dayXX/main.lua
```

where `XX` is a day number (for example `01`).
